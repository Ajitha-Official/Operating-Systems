| -type f               | Hereby, we define the type of the searched object. In this case, 'f' stands for 'file'.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -name *.conf	        | With '-name', we indicate the name of the file we are looking for. The asterisk (*) stands for 'all' files with the '.conf' extension.                                                                                                                                         |

| -exec ls -al {} \;  	| This option executes the specified command, using the curly brackets as placeholders for each result. The backslash escapes the next character from being interpreted by the shell because otherwise, the semicolon would terminate the command and not reach the redirection. |
| 2>/dev/null           |	This is a STDERR redirection to the 'null device', which we will come back to in the next section. This redirection ensures that no errors are displayed in the terminal. This redirection must not be an option of the 'find' command.                                        |
