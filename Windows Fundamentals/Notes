Operating System Structure:
--------------------------
Root Directory (a.k.a. Boot Partition - where OS is installed): <drive_letter>:\ (commonly C drive)

| Directory               | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Perflogs                | Can hold Windows performance logs but is empty by default.                                                                                                                              |
| Program Files           | On 32-bit systems, all 16-bit and 32-bit programs are installed here. On 64-bit systems, only 64-bit programs are installed here.                                                        |
| Program Files (x86)     | 32-bit and 16-bit programs are installed here on 64-bit editions of Windows.                                                                                                             |
| ProgramData             | This is a hidden folder that contains data that is essential for certain installed programs to run. This data is accessible by the program no matter what user is running it.            |
| Users                   | This folder contains user profiles for each user that logs onto the system and contains the two folders Public and Default.                                                             |
| Default                 | This is the default user profile template for all created users. Whenever a new user is added to the system, their profile is based on the Default profile.                              |
| Public                  | This folder is intended for computer users to share files and is accessible to all users by default. This folder is shared over the network by default but requires a valid network account to access. |
| AppData                 | Per user application data and settings are stored in a hidden user subfolder (e.g., `cliff.moore\AppData`). Each of these folders contains three subfolders:                              |
|                          | - Roaming: Contains machine-independent data that should follow the user's profile, such as custom dictionaries.                                                                         |
|                          | - Local: Specific to the computer itself and is never synchronized across the network.                                                                                                  |
|                          | - LocalLow: Similar to the Local folder, but it has a lower data integrity level and can be used by web browsers set to protected or safe mode.                                         |
| Windows                 | The majority of the files required for the Windows operating system are contained here.                                                                                                 |
| System, System32, SysWOW64 | Contains all DLLs required for the core features of Windows and the Windows API. The operating system searches these folders any time a program asks to load a DLL without specifying an absolute path. |
| WinSxS                  | The Windows Component Store contains a copy of all Windows components, updates, and service packs.                                                                                       |

| Command | Syntax                        | Example                                | Description                                                                                             |
|---------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dir     | dir [<path>] [/a] [/s] [/b]   | dir c:\ /a                            | Lists contents of a directory. Includes hidden files when `/a` is used, /s - Display all files in subdirectories, /b - Bare Output Format                                |
| tree    | tree [<path>] [/f] [/a]       | tree "c:\Program Files (x86)\VMware"    | Graphically displays folder structure of a directory and subdirectories.                                |
| tree    | tree <path> /f | more         | tree c:\ /f | more                 | Lists all files and directories in a specified path, pausing output one screen at a time. /f- Display File Names, /a - Use ASCII          |
| more    | <command> | more              | tree c:\ | more                    | Paginates the output of a command, useful for large amounts of data.                                   |
